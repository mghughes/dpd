dpd
Author: Matthieu Hughes

A program which uses the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method to model the dynamics of polymers in explicit solvent.

Current funcionality includes:
    - Polymer translocation through a nanopore
    - Polymer tethered to a wall
    - Free polymer


BUILD:
Compile all.c in the src directory (requires link to math library). Other options in makefile don't currently work (will change this in the future).


RUN:
Run in a directory with input file dpd.inp. Or use sub.sh and run.sh to submit jobs to any Sun Grid Engine system.


INPUT PARAMETERS:
